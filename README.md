# Imperium
### A progressive 4X Strategy / City-builder modification for Minecraft

##### Additional details (goal, background, features, etc.) at the [Minecraft Forums thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2140517-prototype-imperium-4x-strategy-city-builder).

#### Requirements:
* Minecraft v1.7.10
* Forge 10.13.2.1230

#### Building:
* Same as usual, 'gradle build' or 'gradlew build'.
* build.cmd is my own helper script for versioning, it expects GnuWin32 sed/grep in your PATH. Not really important for you :)
