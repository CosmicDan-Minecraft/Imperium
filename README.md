# Minecraft Empires
### A progressive sandbox/adventure "bridgemod" or "megamod" with 4X strategy and roleplaying elements.

##### Additional details (goal, background, features, etc.) at the [Minecraft Forums thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2140517-minecraft-empires-a-progressive-roleplaying).

#### Requirements:
* Minecraft v1.7.10
* Forge v10.13.0.1180

#### Building:
* Same as usual, 'gradle build' or 'gradlew build'.
* build.cmd is my own helper script for versioning, it expects GnuWin32 sed/grep in your PATH. Not really important for you :)
